# Literate Chess Puzzle Solving with Org

Every Wednesday in my town, there's a pub quiz at the Queens Head.
Richard, the landlord, runs a very quirky quiz where the prize hardly ever
goes to the team in first place.  A typical announcement would be, "Totally
chosen at random by a passing Nun, tonight's Star Prize is a Luxury Deluxe
bottle of Prosecco and will go to the team that comes third!".

He also takes out adverts for the pub in a local monthly magazine called
The Fuddler.  Every month, along with the advert, there's a mate-in-2 chess
puzzle.  Richard is quite into chess, and I don't know where he gets the
puzzles from, but they're always quite fiendish.
