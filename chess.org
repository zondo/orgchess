Every Wednesday in my town, there's a pub quiz at the Queens Head.
Richard, the landlord, runs a very quirky quiz where the prize hardly ever
goes to the best team.  A typical announcement would be, "Totally chosen at
random by a passing Nun, tonight's Star Prize is a Luxury Deluxe bottle of
Prosecco, going to the team that comes third!".

He also takes out adverts for the pub in a local monthly magazine called
The Fuddler.  Every month, along with the advert, there's a mate-in-2 chess
puzzle.  Richard is a chess fan; I don't know where he gets the puzzles
from, but they're always quite fiendish.

In the puzzle above, the Black King is hemmed in and can't move.  All White
needs to do is give check, which looks easy: *RxN*, which also removes the
troublesome Knight, and the King still has nowhere to go.  But there's an
escape: *Qf5*, blocking the Rook check.  The Rook can simply take the
Queen, giving check again, but now Black has another escape move: *Ke4*,
since the Bishop is now blocked by the Rook.

And that's as far as I got with this one.

This happens a lot.  Even if I think I've worked out the answer, I'm never
completely sure about it.  And, slightly annoyingly, there's never any
answer to the puzzle in the next issue.  But I'd like to know what I've
missed, mainly to get that "Aha!" moment.  So... I decided to find some
tools to help.

I looked at [[https://lichess.org][Lichess]], which is a great free online chess tool, and accepts
board positions in FEN format.  For the puzzle above, the FEN format is:

#+begin_src ascii
5K2/3PRnQB/2p5/3p4/5k2/7q/2N5/4N3 w - - 0 1
#+end_src

You can get it to set up the position like [[https://lichess.org/analysis/standard/5K2/3PRnQB/2p5/3p4/5k2/7q/2N5/4N3#0][this]].  Its Stockfish analysis
mode will come up with a mate in 2:

: 1. Ne3
: 2. Qf5  N3g2#

Hmm.  OK, that's mate, but what if Black had done something different?
